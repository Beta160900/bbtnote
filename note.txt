npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch

this doccument will use materializecss and tailwindcss and https://daisyui.com/ (library on top of tailwindcss)



1. Class Name Conflicts
Both Materialize and Tailwind have utility classes like container, row, card, or flex. If both frameworks use the same class names but apply different styles, it can cause unpredictable layouts.
Example: Materialize's container sets max-width with padding, while Tailwind's container applies responsive widths.
Solution:

Use scoped CSS or custom prefixes in Tailwind to avoid naming conflicts (e.g., by configuring Tailwind to generate classes like tw-container instead of container).
2. File Size and Performance
Both frameworks load many CSS rules. Including both in the same project can significantly increase the CSS file size, which may slow down page loading.
Solution:

Use PurgeCSS with Tailwind to remove unused CSS and reduce file size.
Only import specific components from Materialize that you need instead of the entire library.
3. Styling Philosophy Differences
Tailwind is utility-first, meaning it encourages small, composable classes, while Materialize offers more pre-built components. Using both might make your CSS messy and inconsistent.
Solution:

Decide on a primary framework (Tailwind for utility classes or Materialize for components) and use the other only for specific cases.
4. JavaScript Conflicts (If Using Materialize JS)
If you are also including Materialize's JavaScript components, they may interfere with other frameworks or libraries, especially if Tailwind's components rely on JavaScript.
Solution:

Ensure that you only initialize and use Materializeâ€™s components when necessary. You might also need to handle potential event conflicts manually.
